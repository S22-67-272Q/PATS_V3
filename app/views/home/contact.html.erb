        <p>Unfortunately, the Pittsburgh 
            Animal Treatment Services is not a real veterinarian website, but rather a 
            sample project for programming students at Carnegie Mellon University. We 
            are sure that you wanted treatment for your pets from the most exquisite 
            veterinarians on the planet, but that's how it goes sometimes.  If you are 
            bitterly disappointed <em>(and quite honestly, you should be)</em> and want to 
            grouse to someone, here's the contact information below.

        <p >*I am a professor of information systems at Carnegie Mellon 
          University and this nickname was a little running joke between myself and my 
          students that I adopted as my signature for my programming work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
